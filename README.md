# PyRocket

Rocket simulation/game with physics in python.

Goal: Point A to point B in least amount of time.

I also didn't have time to place a rocket image

Known Issues:

What: Framerate decreases with time.

Why: Pygame cant handle drawing so many points on the minimap

Temporary fix: close and open the game
